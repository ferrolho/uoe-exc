Task 1 Mark: 2   #
Task 2 Mark: 1.5 # If an empty line appeared exactly once in the data, your solution would not print it. - You could make it more efficient by using an appropriate combiner.
Task 3 Mark: 1.5 # A mapper should have produced only the lengths of longest token and line it observed. However you use combiners which alleviate the problem although this still resulted in unneccessary sorting (+0.5pt)
Task 4 Mark: 5   # Good job on using a combiner.
Task 5 Mark: 1   # This could be solved using only 1 MR job, if your mapper was accumulating the top 20 counts in a priority queue and only printed those.
Task 6 Mark: 2   # Inefficient because your are using an ubounded list.
Task 7 Mark: 3   # Nice (;
Task 8 Mark: 3   #
